Summary: Parametr funkcji bagoffeatures dotyczący wybierania punktów na zdjęciu.


You can extract features based on a feature detector, or you can define a grid to extract 
feature descriptors. The grid method may lose fine-grained scale information. 
Therefore, use the grid for images that do not contain distinct features, such as an image 
containing scenery, like the beach. Using speeded up robust features (or SURF) detector
 provides greater scale invariance. By default, the algorithm runs the 'grid' method.

PointSelection — Selection method for picking point locations
'Grid' (default) | 'Detector'
Selection method for picking point locations for SURF feature extraction, specified as 
the comma-separated pair consisting of 'PointSelection' and either 'Grid' or 'Detector'. 
There are two stages for feature extraction. First, you select a method for picking 
the point locations, (SURF 'Detector' or 'Grid'), with the PointSelection property. 
The second stage extracts the features. The feature extraction uses a SURF extractor for 
both point selection methods.
When you set PointSelection to 'Detector', the feature points are selected using a 
speeded up robust feature (SURF) detector. Otherwise, the points are picked on a predefined 
grid with spacing defined by 'GridStep'. This property applies only when you 
are not specifying a custom extractor with the CustomExtractor property.
